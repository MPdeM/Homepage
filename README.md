# Homepage

This is a basic portfolio/homepage to keep track of projects and other interesting stuff. 

Basic static application consiting on: 
  - index.html: bio home page
  - portfolio.html:  links to 1) coding-related page, 2) bioengineering research publications, and also lists "challenges" that I started during the summer of covid pandemic. 
  - projects.html: coding-related projects that can be found on my github repository
  - publications.html: list of some of my papers from when I was in academia.
  - resume.html: some basic stuff that can be found mostly on linkedIn
